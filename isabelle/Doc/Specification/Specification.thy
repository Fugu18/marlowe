section \<open>The Marlowe Model\<close>
text \<open>TODO: Add parts of the section "The Marlowe Model" from the
2019 paper that helps introduce Marlowe. 
The paper starts describing some of the data types, in here I would 
point to the Marlowe Core Data Types instead with more in depth description

I would also add a Note of internal accounts here.
