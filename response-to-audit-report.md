# 2 Findings


## 2.1 Main concerns


### 2.1.1 Negative deposits allow stealing funds *(Severity: High)*

> **File `marlowe-cardano-specification.md`, `Constraint 6`**
>
> The income from deposits is computed by adding up the deposit inputs, regardless of whether they are negative, while the semantics considers them as zero deposits. Combined with the absence of a balance check on the ending Marlowe state, this allows the ending balance to differ from the value paid to the Marlowe validator.
> 
> This disagreement can be exploited to steal money from a flawed Marlowe contract that allows a negative deposit. The issue is demonstrated in â€¦.

### 2.1.2 Contracts vulnerable to double satisfaction attacks *(Severity: High)*

> **File `marlowe-cardano-specification.md`, `Constraint 15`**
> 
> No datum is required for outputs fulfilling payments to addresses generated by the evaluation of a Marlowe contract. This implies that these outputs are vulnerable to double satisfaction in transactions involving other contracts that pay to the same wallets. An example is discussed in .
> 
> One way to strengthen the implementation is for the Marlowe validator to demand that outputs paid to addresses contain a datum that identifies the contract instance, like the `TxOutRef` of the validator UTxO being spent. Then cooperation with other contracts is possible without double satisfaction if the validators of the other contracts demand a different datum for their outputs.

### 2.1.3 Missing constructor in equality instance *(Severity: High)*

### 2.1.4 Inaccurate formulation of Money preservation *(Severity: High)*

> **File `specification-v3-rc1.pdf`, Section `3.1 Money preservation`, page *29***
> 
> As the property stands, it is permitted to make deposits in one currency and return payments in a different currency. As long as the sums of the amounts match, the equality is satisfied. Yet it is unlikely that the participants of the contract would agree that money has been preserved.
> 
> Money preservation is a property stated with an equality. The left hand side is the sum of the deposits done by a list of transactions. The right hand side of the equality is the sum of all the payments done in the same list of transactions. Each sum, in turn, is represented as a single integer which aggregates the amounts of the various payments and deposits, irrespective of what currencies correspond to these amounts.


### 2.1.5 Insufficient documentation of Money preservation *(Severity: Medium)*

> **File `specification-v3-rc1.pdf`, Section `3.1 Money preservation`, page *29***
> 
> Money preservation is formulated in terms of functions that are not discussed in the specification. It is necessary to explain the meaning of these functions in sufficient detail so readers can understand the property.


### 2.1.6 Missing description of Merkleization *(Severity: High)*

> **File `specification-v3-rc1.pdf`, `Merkleization`**
> 
> There is no property about merkleization, but merkleization is implemented in the Cardano integration.
> 
> Some relevant properties could be:
> 
> 1.  The merkleized contract produces the same payments as the analogous regular contract.
> 2.  If a merkleized case input is applied successfully, it implies that the contract hash in the input corresponds to the continuation of the contract.
> 3.  Merkleizing and unmerkleizing a contract gives back the original contract.


### 2.1.7 Positive balances are not checked for the output state *(Severity: High)*

> **File `marlowe-cardano-specification.md`, `Constraint 13`** 
> 
> *Positive balances* are only checked for the input, not for the output Marlowe state. If the semantics are flawed, a transaction can produce an unspendable output that does not satisfy this constraint.
> 
> If such a transaction is accepted, no further evaluation will be possible since all subsequent transactions will be rejected due to the very same Constraint 13. This is an hypothetical attack vector, where a malicious actor could send a transaction to block a contract.

### 2.1.8 Non-validated Marlowe states *(Severity: High)*

> **File `marlowe-cardano-specification.md`, `Missing constraint`** 
> 
> The validator is not specified to check that the Marlowe states in the input and output datums are valid. This condition is necessary for the lemmas about the Marlowe semantics to be applicable. The Marlowe state could become invalid if there is a flaw in the implementation of the semantics.
> 
> It also could be possible for the Marlowe state to be invalid if someone pays an output to the Marlowe validator with an invalid Marlowe state. Though this problem could be addressed with off-chain checks that prevent sending transactions that spend outputs with invalid Marlowe states. If off-chain checks are used, a note in the specification about how this is handled would be helpful.
> 
> An example showing betrayed user expectations is discussed in .
> 
> For a valid Marlowe state, the association lists for bound values, accounts, and choices have keys sorted and without duplicates.

### 2.1.9 Total balance of ending state uncomputed *(Severity: High)*

> **File `marlowe-cardano-specification.md`, `Constraint 6`** 
> 
> The constraint says
> 
> > The beginning balance plus the deposits equals the ending balance plus the payments.
> 
> However, the Marlowe validator never computes the total balance of the accounts in the ending Marlowe state. Instead, the ending balance is assumed to be whatever value is paid by the transaction to the Marlowe validator. The natural language should describe precisely what is being checked.

### 2.1.10 Unchecked ending balance *(Severity: High)*

> **File `marlowe-cardano-specification.md`, `Constraint 5`** 
> 
> The balance of the starting Marlowe state is checked to match the value in the input. However, the validator does not check that the ending balance matches the value in the output paid to the Marlowe validator. Similarly to IssueÂ [\[main:positive-balances-unchecked\]](#main:positive-balances-unchecked){reference-type="ref" reference="main:positive-balances-unchecked"}, if there are flaws in the semantics that cause the ending balance to differ from the actual value paid to the validator, this constraint would prevent any transaction from spending the output.
> 
> The specification should at least discuss why the check is absent together with the other similar checks that are not implemented (checking that ending accounts have positive balances, checking that the ending Marlowe state is valid).

### 2.1.11 Partial functions used outside their domain *(Severity: Medium)*

> **File `MoneyPreservation.thy`, various functions ``**
> 
> `moneyInRefundOneResult`, `moneyInApplyResult`, `moneyInApplyAllResult`, `moneyInTransactionOutput`, and `moneyInPlayTraceResult` have strange meanings when the result is an error. Arguably, on error there is no money to retrieve, so the return type should be `(Token \times int) option` instead.
> 
> Some lemmas rely on this behavior to have equalities hold even in cases of errors, but the cost is that the meaning is so surprising that the reader may be confused by it. It would be more reliable to have explicit and weaker lemmas that assert equalities only when there are no errors.


### 2.1.12 Different insertion functions used in Isabelle and Haskell code *(Severity: High)*

> **File `Semantics.hs`, Several functions ``** 
> 
> Where `MList.insert` is used in the Isabelle semantics, [AssocMap.insert](https://github.com/input-output-hk/plutus/blob/v1.0.0/plutus-tx/src/PlutusTx/AssocMap.hs#L147-L148) is used in the Cardano implementation. However, the functions are not equivalent as demonstrated by the following examples:
> 
> ``` text
> AssocMap.insert 'a' 1 [('b', 0)] == [('b', 0), ('a', 1)]
> -- whereas
> MList.insert 'a' 1 [('b', 0)] == [('a', 1), ('b', 0)]
> ```
> 
> ``` text
> AssocMap.insert 'b' 1 [('a', 0), (â€˜bâ€™, 0), (â€˜bâ€™, 0)] == [('a', 0), ('b', 1), (â€˜bâ€™, 1)]
> -- whereas
> MList.insert 'b' 1 [(â€˜aâ€™, 0), ('b', 0), ('b', 0)] == [('a', 0), ('b', 1), ('b', 0)]
> ```
> 
> This renders the Isabelle lemmas inapplicable for the Cardano integration. The lemmas need to demand some properties of an `insert` function without fully spelling it out, or the Cardano integration needs to use `MList.insert` instead of `AssocMap.insert`.
> 
> Similarly, functions `AssocMap.delete` and `MList.delete` differ in behavior when the input map is not sorted:
> 
> ``` text
> AssocMap.delete 'a' [(â€˜bâ€™, 0), (â€˜aâ€™, 0)] == [('b', 0)]
> -- whereas
> MList.delete 'a' [(â€˜bâ€™, 0), ('a', 0)] == [('b', 0), ('a', 0)]
> ```
> 
> Functions `AssocMap.lookup` and `MList.lookup` also differ in behavior when the input map is not sorted:
> 
> ``` text
> AssocMap.lookup 'a' [(â€˜bâ€™, 0), (â€˜aâ€™, 0)] == Just 0
> -- whereas
> MList.lookup 'a' [(â€˜bâ€™, 0), ('a', 0)] == Nothing
> ```
> 
> The following usage places were found:
> -   Line 395, `evalValue` depends on `moneyInAccount` which depends on `AssocMap.lookup`.

## 2.2 Marlowe specification


### 2.2.1 Lack of explanation regarding changing choices *(Severity: Low)*

> **File `specification-v3-rc1.pdf`, Section `2.1.4 Choices`, page *10***
> 
> Choices can only be changed when evaluating `When` statements. This is something only evident after looking at the implementation of `computeTransaction`. It needs to be discussed when first introducing choices and the `When` contract.


### 2.2.2 Undefined reference *(Severity: Low)*

> **File `specification-v3-rc1.pdf`, Section `2.1.7 Contracts`, page *13***
> 
> There is an undefined reference.


### 2.2.3 Lack of explanation for necessity of `Environment` type *(Severity: Low)*

> **File `specification-v3-rc1.pdf`, Section `2.1.8 State and Environment`, page *14***
> 
> An `Environment` type is introduced, but it is unclear why it is needed as it is defined as a synonym for time intervals.


### 2.2.4 Unclear meaning of execution environment *(Severity: Low)*

> **File `specification-v3-rc1.pdf`, Section `2.1.8 State and Environment`, page *14***
> 
> The meaning of the execution environment of the transaction is unclear. This is due to the concept of *transaction* being assumed by the specification and never formally introduced.
> 
> The specification reads
> 
> > The execution environment of a Marlowe contract simply consists of the (inclusive) time interval within which the transaction is occurring.
> 
> One has to infer that evaluating a Marlowe contract is undefined if it does not happen within a transaction, as otherwise the description of the execution environment would not make sense. It would be necessary to establish more explicitly the relationship between the contract evaluation and the notion of transaction.


### 2.2.5 Unexplained interval data types *(Severity: Low)*

> **File `specification-v3-rc1.pdf`, Section `2.1.8 State and Environment`, page *14***
> 
> The meaning of the data types `IntervalError` and `IntervalResult` needs to be explained.


### 2.2.6 Incomplete explanation for `TransactionOutput` *(Severity: Low)*

> **File `specification-v3-rc1.pdf`, Section `2.2.1 Compute Transaction`, page *15***
> 
> The meaning of the data type `TransactionOutput` needs to be explained. More generally, the meaning of the return types of most functions has to be explained. Currently, the meaning can only be inferred from looking at how the types are used, which makes it harder to identify if they are used as intended.
> 
> The purpose of these types needs to be made explicit so it can be checked if the code is doing what is intended.


### 2.2.7 Code snippets switch languages *(Severity: Low)*

> **File `specification-v3-rc1.pdf`, Section `2.2.1 Compute Transaction`, page *15***
> 
> The specification changes from using Isabelle to using Haskell henceforth. Making the reader aware of the criteria for the language change would help maintaining the document.


### 2.2.8 Repeated definition of `IntervalResult` *(Severity: Low)*

> **File `specification-v3-rc1.pdf`, Sections `2.1.8 State and Environment, 2.2.2 Fix Interval`, pages *14, 16***
> 
> The `IntervalResult` type is defined twice in the specification. One should be removed.


### 2.2.9 Poorly named variable `newAccount` *(Severity: Low)*

> **File `specification-v3-rc1.pdf`, Section `2.2.6 Reduce Contract Step`, page *19***
> 
> In the implementation of the function `reduceContractStep`, the variable `newAccount` should be named `newAccounts`.


### 2.2.10 Poorly named variable `acc` in specification *(Severity: Low)*

> **File `specification-v3-rc1.pdf`, Section `2.2.8 Apply Cases`, page *22***
> 
> On the last equation of `applyCases`, `acc` should be named `input`.


### 2.2.11 Inaccurate specification of `giveMoney` *(Severity: Low)*

> **File `specification-v3-rc1.pdf`, Section `2.2.9 Utilities`, page *22***
> 
> It says
> 
> > The *giveMoney* function transfers funds internally between accounts.
> 
> which is not accurate. It should say instead
> 
> > The *giveMoney* function deposits funds to an internal account.
>

### 2.3.1 Unnecessarily large proofs *(Severity: Medium)*

> **Several Isabelle files, several lemmas**
> 
> Some Isabelle proofs are written with long apply-scripts, where Isar would document the proof better. Proofs could also be split using more auxiliary lemmas.
> 
> As the proofs stand, it is hard to figure out why a proof step fails, after changes elsewhere required a proof to be updated. Since the newly-failing proof step was designed with specific goals in mind, and changes in the code may lead to it facing a different set of goals, the maintainer might need to reconstruct the whole structure of the proof from an older version to infer state that Isabelle produces at each step.

> What Isar brings is making the intention of the author explicit at every step of the proof. This helps the maintainer of the proofs and fixes the concerns mentioned above.
> 
> Â will likely have to update the proofs. We conjecture that it will happen at least every time they target a new platform. In the case of Cardano, they need to extend the semantics to explain Merkleization. Another action that would make long proofs easier to understand is to split them using more auxiliary lemmas, thus feeding the information to the reader in smaller chunks.

### 2.3.2 Long lines in lemmas *(Severity: Low)*

> **Several Isabelle files, several lemmas**
> 
> Lines are sometimes long which makes it difficult to understand the lemmas. Lemmas need to be formulated expressing one hypothesis per line and the conclusion on a separate line. Complex hypotheses need to be indented using several lines to expose their structure.

### 2.3.3 Confusing auxiliary lemmas *(Severity: Low)*

> **Several Isabelle files, several lemmas**
> 
> Some Isabelle proofs resort to declaring auxiliary lemmas with names suffixed with *\_aux*. Sometimes these lemmas are not expressed succinctly, and look more like a punctual copy of the state of some particular proof that is later developed. For the sake of maintaining the proofs, it would be necessary to structure them in a way that presents the information piecewise to the reader. More generally, even auxiliary lemmas should have a well-defined meaning.
>

### 2.3.4 Undescriptive variable names *(Severity: Low)*

> **Several Isabelle files, several lemmas**
> 
> Many Isabelle proof statements and proofs use uninformative variable names. The most common example occurs with variables named $\mathit{x11}, \mathit{x12}$, etc. These inhibit the reader from easily understanding the lemma statements, and often require looking back at constructors to understand what these variables represent.

> **File `MoneyPreservation.thy`, lemma `transferMoneyBetweenAccounts_preserves_aux`, line *257***
> 
> The lemma uses a variable `valTrans` where other proofs use the name `paidMoney`. To convey the meaning of the variable faster, the same name should be used consistently in all places.

### 2.3.11 Missing theorem regarding `playTrace` *(Severity: Low)*

> **File `PositiveAccounts.thy`, `playTrace preserves valid and positive state`** 
> 
> There is no theorem that `playTrace` keeps the state valid and positive when given a state which is valid and positive. This trivially follows from `playTraceAux_preserves_validAndPositive_state` but no such theorem is present.


### 2.3.12 Unconcise goal in `reduceContractStepPayIsQuiescent` *(Severity: Low)*

> **File `QuiescentResult.thy`, lemma `reduceContractStepPayIsQuiescent`, line *8***
> 
> This lemma does not express its goal concisely, as it makes no mention of `reduceContractStep` in the formulation. Changing the first assumption to $\texttt{reduceContractStep}\ \mathit{env}\ \mathit{sta}\ (\texttt{Pay}\ \mathit{x21}\ \mathit{x22}\ \mathit{tok}\ \mathit{x23}\ \mathit{x24})$ makes more explicit in which contexts this lemma can be useful. Modifying this assumption requires an additional `apply simp` to be added to the proof (before line 30) for the lemma to go through. Further, an additional `apply simp` will need to be added in lemmas `reduceContractStepIsQuiescent` (before line 44) and `timedOutReduce_only_quiescent_in_close` (`Timeout.thy`, before line 128) as well.

> **File `Semantics.thy`, function `applyAllLoop`, line *575***
> 
> The $\texttt{cont}$ variable introduced by the pattern match shadows another $\texttt{cont}$ variable, coming from the pattern match of an outer case expression, making the function harder to follow while also making it more error-prone to future changes.

### 2.4.5 Unclear need for multiple formulations for positive accounts *(Severity: Low)*

> **File `PositiveAccounts.thy`, `Throughout`** 
> 
> It is unclear what the use is for multiple formulations (and lemmas about) positive accounts. The first formulation (with the theorems `playTraceAux_gtZero` and `playTrace_gtZero`) is not used in any other modules but the alternative formulation is used instead. If both formulations are relevant, then it should be explained why.


### 2.4.6 Variable name discrepancy in `reductionLoop` *(Severity: Low)*

> **File `Semantics.thy`, function `reductionLoop`** 
> 
> When comparing this function against `specification-v3-rc1.pdf`, different names are used for a let-bound variable. It is `a` in the pdf and `newPayments` in the file `Semantics.thy`. There are similar issues in the function `reduceContractStep` in the equation for the `If` case, and in the function `giveMoney`.


### 2.4.7 Typo in constructor *(Severity: Low)*

> **File `Semantics.thy`, function `applyCases`, line *505***

> 
> The meaning of the function is not obvious. It needs a comment to explain it.


### 2.4.9 Non-modularized file `SingleInputTransactions.thy` *(Severity: Low)*

> **File `SingleInputTransactions.thy`, `Splitting File`** 
> 
> This file is very long, and it covers more than just single-input transactions. For instance, about 530 lines at the beginning are rather dedicated to idempotence of certain operations. Then, the lemmas around lines 530Â -- 700 focus on "well-foundedness" of the recursion on contract steps. Then there is also a clear block of lemmas about "distributivity" of semantics over transaction lists.
> 
> Splitting the module, grouping the related lemmas, would help understanding the relationships between the groups.


### 2.4.10 Misleading function names *(Severity: Low)*

> **File `SingleInputTransactions.thy`, function `inputsToTransactions`, line *9***
> 
> This function name is not very descriptive of its meaning. It takes a transaction (both a time interval and a list of inputs) and returns a list of transactions at the same interval containing a single input each. A name like `splitTransactionIntoSingleInputTransactions` would convey better what the input and the output are.
> 
> Moreover, the code would be cleaner if the function takes a single argument of type `Transaction`, instead of asking the caller to rip apart its fields.
> 
> **File `SingleInputTransactions.thy`, function `traceListToSingleInput`, line *18***
> 
> This function name is not descriptive of what it does. Perhaps a more telling name could be `splitTransactionsIntoSingleInputTransactions`.
> 
> **File `SingleInputTransactions.thy`, function `isSingleInput`, line *1222***
> 
> This function should be renamed or repurposed. If renamed, `allAreSingleInput` more accurately reflects the meaning of the function. If repurposed, it should check that a single transaction has a single input, and `all isSingleInput` can be used to express the current behavior.


### 2.4.11 Unused parameter in `maxTransactionCaseList` *(Severity: Low)*

> **File `TransactionBound.thy`, function `maxTransactionCaseList`, line *16***
> 
> This function has a parameter of type `State` that is completely unused and can be removed.


### 2.4.12 Duplicated `isValidInterval` function *(Severity: Low)*

> **File `TimeRange.thy`, function `isValidInterval`, line *231***
> 
> This function duplicates $\texttt{validTimeInterval}$ from $\texttt{OptBoundTimeInterval.thy}$, and the latter has certain additional properties proven about it specifically, so it makes sense to use the latter in both cases.

### 2.6.10 Constraint implementations differ from description *(Severity: Low)*

> **File `marlowe-cardano-specification.md`, Section `Plutus Validator for Marlowe Semantics`** 
> 
> Some constraints mentioned in the specification are written in a different structure than the corresponding constraint in `Scripts.hs`. While such a discrepancy may be useful to minimize verbosity, a unified structure when possible would alleviate a side-by-side comparison. Examples of these differing structures include Constraint 6 and Constraint 14.

## 2.7 Haskell tests


### 2.7.1 More precise failure checks *(Severity: Medium)*

> **File `Spec/Marlowe/Plutus/Specification.hs`, `Various tests`** 
> 
> The tests use the functions `checkSemanticsTransaction` and `checkPayoutTransaction` to verify that various error conditions cause transactions to be rejected. These functions test that a transaction passes or fails, but when it fails, the functions do not consider the error cause. Checking the exact cause is necessary to ensure the transaction is rejected because of the intended reason and not because of some other error condition arising in a particular test case by coincidence.
> 
> The absence of this information makes it easier to accidentally produce a test that is not testing what is intended.

> -   payment subtracts from an account,
> -   deposit adds to an account,
