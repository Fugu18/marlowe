\section{Introduction}


\noindent
\sjtnote{This is a preliminary version, return to this at the end of the writing process.}

This paper explores the design of a domain specific language, Marlowe,\footnote{Marlowe is named after Christopher Marlowe, the Elizabethan poet, dramatist and spy, who was born and educated in Canterbury: \url{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Marlowe}}\footnote{The code for Marlowe is available from \url{https://github.com/input-output-hk/scdsl}
} targetted at the execution of financial contracts in the style of Peyton Jones, Eber and Seward~\cite{PeytonJones:2000} on blockchains. This work is a part of the Cardano project, and is supported by IOHK.\footnote{\url{https://iohk.io}} 

In doing this we are required to refine the model of contracts in a number of ways in order to fit with a radically different context. 
\begin{itemize}
\item In the traditional model, enforcement of the contract is the responsibility of the legal system; in the decentralised blockchain model, in which there is no central authority, the contract needs to be enforced by design. 
\item There is not a single blockchain model, and we give a brief overview of the different mechanisms for scripting on blockchain (although this is not the primary purpose of this article). 
\begin{itemize}
\item
A particularly important technical distinction here is that between an account-style model as used by Ethereum~\cite{EthereumRationale}, and the unspent transaction output (UTxO) model of bitcoin~\cite{sok}. 
\item There is the question of how precisely the execution of the contract interacts with the blockchain, and how information is to be recorded on the chain.
\item Does the execution ``push'' for changes  to happen, or do external actors have to ``pull'' to effect changes enabled by execution of the contract?
\end{itemize}
\item \sjtnote{What else do we want to say here?}
\end{itemize}

\noindent
\sjtnote{Preliminary overview; need to revisit.}
The paper is structured like this: we begin with an overview of the model, including the assumptions made in designing 
it, the types of the principal functions and a description of the DSL as an algebraic type, constructor by constructor. 
The section aims to give a high level overview, and some of the concrete details are to be found in the repo. We follow 
this with discussions of the kinds of formal analysis which might be made for the DSL, as well as discussing a  set of 
questions raised by the process of modelling. We then look at the example of ``incentivised saving'', as an 
illustration, and then look at how Marlowe relates to other work in the area. We conclude by pointing out 

\sjtnote{To talk about, in no particular order \ldots}
\begin{itemize}
\item
Marlowe as the ``canary in the coalmine'': test out how it will work, how it will interface with
other aspects of the Cardano platform
\item
Be clear that this paper describes version 1.2 of Marlowe.
\item 
Enforcement and promptness.
\end{itemize}


\section{Design rationale}

\sjtnote{References to some of the background work still to be added.}

\medskip
\noindent
In this section we look at existing work on smart contracts and blockchains in general, before exploring the rationale for building the Marlowe language.

\subsection{Smart contracts on blockchains}

As more than one wag has observed, many of the programs that run on blockchains are neither smart nor indeed form contracts in any real sense. Nonetheless, this terminology has stuck, and has become shorthand for ``programmed interactions on the blockchain''. In an earlier paper we presented a survey of the approaches available~\cite{cryptoeprint:2016:1156}; we give an overview here.

Blockchains are executed in a replicated form by parties who cannot be guaranteed not to be hostile, either by directly trying to change the contents of the chain, or through trying to affect other properties of the chain by indirect means (such as swamping honest parties with work). Programming on the blockchain therefore needs to be constrained in some ways, since it has to be amenable to replication or verification within a reasonable time if the security and integrity of the chain are to be preserved. We look at representatives of the main approaches now.

\paragraph{Bitcoin script}

One approach to this is to choose mechanisms such as bitcoin script which are manifestly non-Turing complete. A bitcoin script, written in a Forth-like language, is essentially linear: it can branch, but the language contains neither looping constructs nor recursion. It is therefore straightforward not only to see that scripts will terminate, but also to give an accurate estimate of the time taken to execute a script. 

\paragraph{Ethereum}

On the other hand, the Ethereum system provides a Turing-complete language for the EVM virtual machine, and a higher-level programming language, Solidity, that compiles into EVM code. However, EVM and Solidity programs are constrained \emph{post hoc} by two mechanisms: program execution must be paid for using `gas' proportional to the effort expended, and a set of \emph{ad hoc} limits on program execution, e.g.\ on stack size.

\paragraph{Nxt}

Programmability of the system is provided through a ``fat'' high-level API, which is accessible from Nxt clients through a REST interface. The API provides functionality supporting various kinds of transactions. The core software itself doesn't support any form of scripting language; rather, users are expected to work with the built in transaction types and transactions that support some 250 primitive operations; these can be ``scripted'' in a client (only) using a binding to the API, which is available, for instance, in JavaScript.

\paragraph{Multiple languages}

A common feature of many blockchain platforms is that they provide multiple scripting languages. As we noted earlier, Ethereum can be programmed at the EVM level as well as by using the high-level Solidity language. Tezos~\cite{tezos-white-paper} supports the stack-based, strongly-typed, functional language Michelson, but also provides a high-level language, Liquidity, that compiles into Michelson. Liquidity is also functional and strongly typed, but provides more constructs in a more familiar syntax, namely that of a subset of OCaml. 

The \ae{}ternity system~\cite{aeternity} provides multiple languages and VMs:\footnote{As presented by Erik Stenman at CODE BEAM SF, March 2018, \url{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXsqvfPIdWg}} the functional language  Sophia (akin to Reason) and the Functional Typed Warded Virtual Machine (FTWVM) for safe ``system level programming'', the language Varna and the HLM for simple contracts, and a (port of) Solidity and the EVM for compatibility with Ethereum. In a similar way, Cardano provides support for IELE~\sjtnote{citation}, a rational reconstruction of the EVM, and thus for Solidity contracts too. 

\paragraph{Domain-specific languages} 

A domain-specific language or DSL is a high-level language designed to work in a specific field or domain. The intention is that because the users will know about the field, the constructs of the language can be designed to be meaningful to them, and also that because of its nature the DSL need not include all the features of a general purpose language. Removing this clutter and having the remaining operations directly reflect the application area is intended to make the language more accessible to domain experts who do not necessarily see themselves as programmers.

Stand-alone DSLs have the advantage of providing appropriate, domain-level error messages when things go wrong, but suffer the disadvantage of having to be implemented from scratch. An alternative to this are \emph{embedded} DSLs (EDSLs), which provide a ``little language'' for the particular domain embedded within a general-purpose host language. This means that parts of the host -- such as arithmetical expressions, or list idioms --  can be used to extend the expressibility of the DSL. A notable example of this is the financial contracts language described by Peyton Jones and his collaborators~\cite{PeytonJones:2000}, which is embedded in Haskell.

\paragraph{Other approaches}

There are a variety of other approaches to scripting, including business process notations, such as the OMG's BPMN; process calculi such as Rholang; logic rules (in Formal Contract Logic), and finite state machines. More details of these are provided in~\cite{cryptoeprint:2016:1156}.

\paragraph{Related work}

The Findel~\cite{findel} project examines financial contracts on the Ethereum platform, and the authors note that  payments need to be bounded; this is made concrete in our account by our notion of commitments. They take no account of commitments or timeouts as we do below, but it should be noted that the Ethereum platform is more powerful than the one that we target in this paper.


\subsection{Blockchain platforms: Cardano and others}

There is not a single model of how a blockchain operates, and in this section we look at some of the tradeoffs possible in this space. This allows us to give a context to some of the design decisions taken in designing Marlowe.  

\paragraph{UTxO and accounts}

The simplest blockchain is Bitcoin. Transactions on Bitcoin are made by spending the (as yet) unspent outputs of previous transactions (`unspent transaction outputs' or UTxOs).The chain need not maintain any state, such as the current value owned by any particular participant: such \emph{account} information is implicit and external to the Bitcoin blockchain. On the other hand, the Ethereum model explicitly keeps track of account values, and so this information needs to be kept as state information on chain. While it is possible to translate between UTxO-based and account-based chains \sjtnote{cite Bruno paper} the UTxO model is more fundamental, and requires less support from the implementation of the chain itself.

\paragraph{Interaction modality}

Contracts can be conceived of as acting in two ways. In a \emph{push} model, contracts are seen to be pro-active, and to make things happen. In the case of blockchain, this would include making payments or transactions happen. Alternatively, in the \emph{pull} model contracts enable certain things to happen, such as transactions, but the transactions need to be effected by an external player. The pull model makes fewer demands on the blockchain implementation than the push model, which requires the contract to have direct access to modify the chain.

\paragraph{Layered design and sidechains}

Some chains have a layered design, in particular Cardano~\cite{cardano}. The Cardano Settlement Layer (SL) is to support settlement of transactions but nothing more complicated, whereas the Computation Layer (or CL) supports more powerful general computations over the chain. Moreover, the Cardano roadmap \cite{cardano-rationale} envisages the possibility of computation taking place, in part at least, on a sidechain rather than on the main chain itself, which may support only the SL. Other off-chain approaches include the Lightning network, overlaid on blockchains (usually Bitcoin) and the channels of \ae{}ternity, introduced below.

\subsection{Designing Marlowe}

In designing Marlowe we have chosen a number of options; this description applies to Marlowe version 1.2 \sjtnote{Is there an obvious way of making that clear in the repo? I really don't understand how git deals with ``releases'' or versions.}

\paragraph{Pull} 

While earlier versions used a ``push'' model of operations, we have revised the language to give a ``pull'' semantics. This means, for example, that the language can \emph{enable} a payment to be made, but cannot make the payment happen. It is up to the interested party (or parties) to make the change happen. It is therefore possible for the payment not to happen, despite the fact that this is against the interest of the receiving party. The same 

\paragraph{UTxO vs.\ accounts} \sjtnote{Pablo: please check this section carefully}

The language semantics is described in terms of \emph{commitments} of sums of cryptocurrency -- which we choose to abbreviate to ``cash'' -- and so is agnostic of the underlying implementation.  However, the current redemption mechanism in Plutus Core is not strong enough to support Marlowe, and we are actively investigating the best way to extend this mechanism to implement Marlowe in full on Plutus Core.

\paragraph{DSL or EDSL?}

Marlowe is described as an algebraic \haskellinline{data} type in Haskell, and as such can be seen as a simple EDSL. Note, however, that the implementation presented here is for the purposes of presenting the semantics and behaviour of the language in the abstract. The implementation on the Cardano platform could be stand-alone, but more likely it will be a DSL embedded in Plutus or Plutus Core. The details of this remain to be decided, as noted in the introduction.

\label{fig:context}
\end{center}
\end{figure}


\section{The model}

The DSL is modelled as an algebraic type in Haskell, together with an executable small-step semantics. 
We start by looking at the different types used by the model, and then look at the \haskellinline{Contract} DSL itself. \sjtnote{To complete this introduction}

\subsection{The model types}

A running contract will interact with its environment in two ways, as shown in Figure \ref{fig:context}.

\paragraph{Observables}


First, it will need to observe different kinds of varying quantities including, for example, the current time, the current block number and, random numbers, as well as ``real world'' quantities like ``the price of oil'' or ``the exchange rate between currencies A and B''. Each instance of such an observable will be recorded on the blockchain to allow the computation to be repeated for verification purposes. It is assumed that at each step of the execution of the contract, the values of some observables will be needed, and these values are (together) given by a value of type \haskellinline{OS}. Note that these values are not determined by the participants in the contract, but rather by the external environment.

\paragraph{Inputs}


On the other hand, at each step there are -- potentially, at least -- a variety of inputs available from the participants. These include commitments of currency (or ``cash''), redemption of commitments, and claims of payments by a participant; moreover it is also possible for a participant to input an arbitrary value (which we term a ``choice''). The particular inputs at a given step are described by a value of type \haskellinline{Input}.

\paragraph{Commitments}


While informally we might see a commitment to something as being indefinite, it is important to realise that on blockchain a commitment needs to have a timeout so that progress can be forced in a game. After the timeout period the cash can be refunded through the user creating a transaction to reclaim the cash.

Moreover, information about the commitments currently in force forms the \haskellinline{State}, which is (potentially) modified at each execution step. 

Finally, payments can be granted by using committed money, but they must be manually redeemed by the recipient, in the 
same way that cash commitments are redeemed when they expire. The effects of the contract in the blockchain are 
represented by a list \haskellinline{AS} of \haskellinline{Action}s that is derived from the execution of each step of the semantics.

\begin{figure}[t]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{pix/step-type.png}
\caption{The \haskellinline{step} function}
\label{fig:step-function}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

\paragraph{The \haskellinline{step} function}


This analysis justifies the type of the \haskellinline{step} function:

\begin{haskellcode}
step :: Input -> State -> Contract -> OS -> (State,Contract,AS)
\end{haskellcode}

which is also shown in Figure \ref{fig:step-function}.

\paragraph{Infrastructure}

The model makes a number of assumptions about the blockchain infrastructure in which it is run.

\begin{itemize}
\item It is assumed that cryptographic functions and operations are provided by a layer external to the system, and so they need not be modelled explicitly here.
\item We assume that time is ``coarse grained'' and measured simply by block number, so that timeouts etc.\ are delimited using nothing finer than block number. 
\item Because we assume a ``pull'' model, making a commitment is not something that a contract can perform; rather, it can enable that a commitment is made, but that then has to be established externally: hence the input of (a set of) commitments at each step. The same observation also applies to redeeming a commitment of cash. Commitments that have been made or redeemed need to be recorded somehow.

\item Observables are observed at a particular time and in a particular context. We assume that the recording and 
identification of each (instance of an) observation is provided by the infrastructure of the system. We provide a 
``little language'' for describing observations: \haskellinline{Observation}. 
\item
Similar properties are true for
\haskellinline{Money} amounts: their values are calculated depending on the inputs and state of execution of the 
contract, they can be deterministically established given the context, and they are described through a small 
``expression language''.
\item It is important to be aware that there may be different instances of contracts executed, and for each instance there will typically be different instances of observables (and commitments) observed and recorded.
\item The model manages the release of funds back to the committer when a cash commitment expires (see discussion of the \haskellinline{fullStep} function below).
\end{itemize}

\subsection{The \haskellinline{Contract} type}

The type of contracts is given by

\begin{haskellcode}
data Contract =
   Null |
   CommitCash IdentCC Person Money Timeout Timeout Contract Contract |  
   RedeemCC IdentCC Contract |
   Pay IdentPay Person Person Money Timeout Contract |  
   Both Contract Contract |
   Choice Observation Contract Contract |
   When Observation Timeout Contract Contract   
   \end{haskellcode}
%Originally on "Choice": \footnote{Doesn't the step function need to record what observations are made, so they can be archived in the blockchain? I don't see how your design will support doing so.}\footnote{Yes, we assume that it is part of the infrastructure of this language to record the values of *observables* that are used. However, we have chosen no to make it part of the language itself.}

\subsection{The \haskellinline{step} function}


The \haskellinline{step} function is total, so that for every contract a result of stepping is defined. However, for some kinds of contracts -- commits, redeems or time-shifted contracts -- it is possible that the result of a step is to produce the same contract as the result; such a step is called \emph{quiescent} whereas all other steps \emph{make progress}. We use this distinction in the explanation that follows.


At each computational step, the \haskellinline{step} function is wrapped by a call to the \haskellinline{fullStep} function, which in addition to performing \haskellinline{step} will enable expired cash commitments to be refunded and record any choices made at that step.


The constructors are interpreted like this:

\begin{itemize} 

\item \haskellinline{Null} is the null contract; it will always be quiescent.

\item \haskellinline{CommitCash idCC p v t1 t2 k1 k2}  For this contract to make progress,\begin{itemize}
\item either before the timeout \haskellinline{t1} the user \haskellinline{p} makes a cash commitment of value 
\haskellinline{v} and timeout \haskellinline{t2}  with the identifier \haskellinline{idCC}, 
\item
or the timeout \haskellinline{t1} is exceed.
\end{itemize} 
In the first case, a \haskellinline{SuccessfulCommit} action is generated and the contract continues as 
\haskellinline{k1}; in the second case no action is generated and the contract continues as 
\haskellinline{k2}. While neither case holds the contract is quiescent, waiting for the cash to be committed. 

If the cash is committed successfully and the timeout \haskellinline{t2} is reached, then it is impossible to further spend the committed cash, and any unspent funds can be reclaimed by participant \haskellinline{p}.
 This is performed by the \haskellinline{fullStep} function, as noted above.

\item \haskellinline{RedeemCC idCC k} (\haskellinline{CC} stands for cash commitment.) For this contract to make progress, the creator of the cash commitment with identifier \haskellinline{idCC} is required to redeem the unspent funds in that commitment; the contract then continues as \haskellinline{k}, and the action \haskellinline{CommitRedeemed} is produced. 
Committed cash can only be redeemed once, and an attempt to redeem it a second time will produce a  \haskellinline{DuplicateRedeem} action, continuing as \haskellinline{k}.

If the cash commitment with identifier \haskellinline{idCC} has expired, it becomes possible for the remaining funds to be redeemed by the committer; this can be done by the \haskellinline{fullStep} function processing the appropriate \haskellinline{Input}, and an \haskellinline{ExpiredCommitRedeemed} action will be produced. 

Once the commitment \haskellinline{idCC} has expired and is redeemed, a \haskellinline{RedeemCC idCC k} contract will immediately evolve to \haskellinline{k}.
%\footnote{How does the contract determine what actions resulted from a given step? Or is this not required?}
%\footnote{If it is required, restructuring the DSL so that the result action appears as the 'value' of executing a step (using a monadic interface as described for id generation below) would be a good idea.}
%\footnote{We specify the actions generated by each kind of constructor; at each step the list of such actions, of type \haskellinline{AS}, is a component of the result.}. 

\item \haskellinline{Pay p1 p2 v t k} makes it possible, assuming that sufficient funds are available, for 
\haskellinline{p1} to claim  a payment of \haskellinline{v} from \haskellinline{p2} before the timeout 
\haskellinline{t}. The contract continues as \haskellinline{k}. By `available' we mean that sufficient commitments have 
been made and  not yet expired to cover the payment; in this case the payment  uses the currency allocated by the cash 
commitments made by \haskellinline{p1} that expire the earliest.

 This contract will result in a \haskellinline{FailedPay} action if the funds are not available; otherwise a \haskellinline{SuccessfulPay} action is generated.

\item \haskellinline{Both k1 k2} enforces the behaviour of both contracts \haskellinline{k1} and \haskellinline{k2}. Because the model is stateful and produces output actions, to make a step it is necessary to execute a single step of each of  the contracts \haskellinline{k1} and \haskellinline{k2} in sequence: first \haskellinline{k1} then \haskellinline{k2}.

\item \haskellinline{Choice obs k1 k2} behaves as either \haskellinline{k1} or \haskellinline{k2} depending on the (Boolean) result of \haskellinline{obs} at the time that the observation is made, \haskellinline{k1} if it is \haskellinline{True} and \haskellinline{k2} if \haskellinline{False}.

\item \haskellinline{When obs timeout k def_k} This contract will not progress until \haskellinline{obs} is \haskellinline{True} or until the current block number is greater than or equal to the one specified by timeout. In case the timeout applies, the contract will continue as \haskellinline{def_k}, if the timeout does not apply and \haskellinline{obs} is \haskellinline{True}, then the contract continues as \haskellinline{k}. Otherwise the contract is quiescent.
\end{itemize}
We look next at an example of Marlowe in action.


\section{Incentivised saving}

In this section, we explain how Marlowe can be used for designing a contract that incentivises saving. We use the 
following example: ``participant 2'' offers 20 ADA to ``participant 1'' in exchange for saving 100 ADA for 100 blocks. 
``Participant 1'' will be able to withdraw the savings after block 20, but if that option is chosen, then ``participant 
2'' will not pay the extra 20 ADA to ``participant 1''.

We will start from outer to inner primitives. The first thing is to allow ``participant 1'' to commit the 100 ADA. The 
primitive says that with identity \haskellinline{IdentCC 1} (this is the identity of the commitment), ``participant 
\haskellinline{1}'' can commit \haskellinline{100} ADA before block \haskellinline{10}, and the commitment must 
expire on block \haskellinline{200}. But if the money is not committed before block \haskellinline{10}, then the 
contract will continue as \haskellinline{Null}.

\begin{haskellcode}
CommitCash (IdentCC 1) 1 (ConstMoney 100) 10 200
           step2
           Null
\end{haskellcode}

If the commitment is done correctly and on time, we continue as in \haskellinline{step2}. \haskellinline{step2} is 
another commitment, this time by ``participant 2''. The primitive says that with identity \haskellinline{IdentCC 2},
``participant \haskellinline{2}'' can commit \haskellinline{20} ADA before block \haskellinline{20}, and the commitment
must expire on block \haskellinline{200}. But if the money is not committed before block \haskellinline{20}, then the
contract will continue as \haskellinline{RedeemCC (IdentCC 1) Null}, which in turn gives ``participant 1'' the 
opportunity to withdraw all the money committed immediately.

\begin{haskellcode}
CommitCash (IdentCC 2) 2 (ConstMoney 20) 20 200
           step3
           (RedeemCC (IdentCC 1) Null)
\end{haskellcode}

If the commitment is done correctly and on time, we continue as in \haskellinline{step3}. \haskellinline{step3}
waits until choice with identity \haskellinline{IdentChoice 1} is made by ``participant \haskellinline{1}'' or
until block \haskellinline{100} (whatever happens first). If the choice is made before block \haskellinline{100}, 
it continues as \haskellinline{stepRedeem}, if block \haskellinline{100} comes first, then it continues as 
\haskellinline{step4}.

\begin{haskellcode}
When (PersonChoseSomething (IdentChoice 1) 1) 100
     stepRedeem
     step4
\end{haskellcode}

\haskellinline{step4} pays the \haskellinline{20} ADA committed by ``participant \haskellinline{2}'' in the commit with 
identity \haskellinline{IdentPay 1} to ``participant \haskellinline{1}'', if the payment is claimed before block 
\haskellinline{200}. Once the payment is claimed or after block 200, it continues as \haskellinline{stepRedeem}.

\begin{haskellcode}
Pay (IdentPay 1) 2 1 (ConstMoney 20) 200 stepRedeem
\end{haskellcode}

Finally, \haskellinline{stepRedeem} allows both participants to redeem all the remaining committed funds.

\begin{haskellcode}
Both (RedeemCC (IdentCC 1) Null)
     (RedeemCC (IdentCC 2) Null)
\end{haskellcode}

The whole contract remains as follows:
\begin{haskellcode}
CommitCash (IdentCC 1) 1
           (ConstMoney 100)
           10 200
           (CommitCash (IdentCC 2) 2
                       (ConstMoney 20)
                       20 200
                       (When (PersonChoseSomething (IdentChoice 1) 1)
                             100

In the next section we cover the online contract visualisation and interaction tool for Marlowe.

\section{Visualising the contract}

\sjtnote{Pablo: can you add something here about the online visualisation, including one or more suitable screenshots? It might be worth giving a condensed screenshot of the whole screen, and then more detailed ones of parts of the display.}

\sjtnote{Should it have a name?}

In the next section we look again at the model and the Marlowe language.

\section{Reflection}
We have given a concrete model and DSL, namely Marlowe version 1.2. In this section we examine how the model can be extended, how contacts can be analysed, reflect on different design decisions that might be made and discuss some aspects of the implementation on Marlowe within a blockchain environment.

\subsection{Potential additions to the model}

The model that we have discussed so far is deliberately kept as compact as possible. However there are a number of potential extensions to the model which we introduce here. 

\paragraph{Value commitments}

We have examined a single kind of commitment, namely a commitment of a certain amount of currency. In different 
applications, such as on-chain game playing of games like poker, a commitment to a value will be required. A value 
commitment would include a choice of a play in a game, which would be chosen and concealed from the other players until 
a later point in play, when it can be revealed. The paper \cite{kumaresan2015use} makes use of this and other 
cryptographic primitives to enforce the rules of poker while maintaining the cards of each player secret.

\paragraph{A monadic DSL}

Haskell is a pure functional programming language, and uses the \haskellinline{Monad} type class to encapsulate operations that can potentially have a side effect. Many introductions to monads exist \sjtnote{cite some} but for the sake of this discussion it is enough to think of a value of type \haskellinline{m a} where \haskellinline{m} is a monad as a ``computation that results in something of type \haskellinline{a}''. The \haskellinline{Monad} API allows such computations to be assembled, and then once assembled they may be run, in general causing some side-effects as a part of the computation.

We can make the \haskellinline{Contract} type monadic, so that new, unique identifiers are automatically generated. This gives two nice properties. First, they are guaranteed to be unique; secondly they can be generated only in cases where a commit has been made successfully (within the required time period). The 
\haskellinline{do} notation supported by monads allows the generated names to be captured by the \haskellinline{bind} operation and referred to later in the computation.


\subsection{Potential model analyses}

Given that we have a language and a semantics for it, we can examine its properties. These might be properties of individual runs of a particular contract, of all runs of a given contract, or indeed properties of all the contracts of the language. In this section we look at two particularly obvious questions, but these are not the only ones that we might ask.



\paragraph{What are the valid contracts?}

One possible definition is ``those contracts that do not lead to a \haskellinline{FailedPay} action''.
Given the mechanisms for making and using commitments are limited by timeouts, it should be possible to write contracts that have this property, perhaps with some assumptions about the value of observables.
Looking at this in a little more detail, we would expect the following points to hold.
\begin{itemize}
\item For a \haskellinline{Pay} contract a sufficient balance not to produce a \haskellinline{FailedPay} or a \haskellinline{DuplicateRedeem} action is required.. 
\item For \haskellinline{Both} we require a sufficient balance for both contracts combined. Need to think here whether the two conjuncts should be independent, or whether a commitment in one half can be used in the other.
\item For \haskellinline{Choice} we require a sufficient balance for the maximum of the requirements of the individual contracts. 
\item For \haskellinline{When}, need to ``age'' the existing commitments relative to the new starting point of the continuation contract. 
\item Are there any constraints on  \haskellinline{CommitCash} and \haskellinline{RedeemCC} statements? Not directly, but there need to be sufficient funds available to pay if needed, or enough time for the commitments to time out, if not.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Do all contracts potentially evaluate to \haskellinline{Null}?}

That is, for each contract do there exist sequences of values of \haskellinline{Commit} and \haskellinline{OS} such that stepping the contract with these inputs leads to \haskellinline{Null}? Some relevant points include:
\begin{itemize}
\item For \haskellinline{When}, need to be able to make \haskellinline{interpretObs st obs os} true. Since there is a timeout to \haskellinline{When} then there's no need to impose this condition, as we'll progress at timeout if not before.
\item As we have put timeouts on to \haskellinline{CommitCash} and \haskellinline{RedeemCC} operations, there are no remaining requirements on these constructs for contract execution to make progress, albeit eventually.
\item We need to check the status of \haskellinline{Observations}: what if an observation is unsatisfiable?
\item There are no constraints on other constructs.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Questions and alternatives}

The model outlined here raises a number of questions, or suggests a number of alternative choices.

\paragraph{Time}

The model does not take time as an observable, but rather it is defined in terms of \haskellinline{BlockNumber} only. We could  use ``slot time'' instead: \emph{``We consider a setting where time is divided into discrete units called slots. A ledger, described in more detail below, associates with each time slot (at most) one ledger block.''}\footnote{\url{https://eprint.iacr.org/2016/889.pdf}}

\paragraph{Timelocks}

In systems where time is significant, it is possible to build ``timelocks'' under which 
it becomes impossible for time to progress. Is it possible for block number to depend on progress of computation? We conjecture not, because otherwise it would be possible to produce timelocks, under which it would become impossible for time to progress. 

\paragraph{Relative time}

Timeouts are expressed in absolute time: presumably they could be relative (with recording on the blockchain of the times at which they are triggered).

\paragraph{Determinism}

The model is deterministic, with all non-determinism being external, and confined to observables. This is surely necessary in order to support computation replay, but does it restrict the expressibility of the model?

\paragraph{Causality}

Is there a notion of causality for these contracts? Would we be able to characterise it semantically? Syntactically?

\paragraph{Expiry}

Does a contract expire if a surrounding commitment does? We have not made this a feature of the model.

\paragraph{Premature repayment}

The \haskellinline{RedeemCC} construct is intended for premature repayment of a cash commitment, i.e. before the commitment has timed out. Alternatively, it would be possible for the underlying model to repay all committed but unspent cash automatically at the end of a contract (but before all commitments have expired), but we might want to do the same thing at the end of each ``round'' of  a game, for instance.

\paragraph{Fungibility}

We have modelled cash as fungible: we make payments using the cash commitments in order of expiry time, with those expiring earliest being used first. Building a model on UTxO might be a reason for using a different approach.


\paragraph{The \haskellinline{Both} construct}

Does the \haskellinline{Both} constructor potentially produce invalid/misleading contracts, combining a commitment in one half with its use in the other? The problem is that the ``use'' conjunct could potentially be executed, leading to a failed payment.

\paragraph{Monotonicity}

Some observables have a ``monotonicity'' property: once a choice is made, it is fixed forever; on the other hand, something not yet chosen is only so thus far; do we need to reflect this in the observations that we allow?


\subsection{Towards an implementation}

The contracts implemented in the Marlowe language have an implicit interface defined for what would correspond to the client side of a distributed application, as shown by the interactive interface. 
We have designed Marlowe assuming that each contract would be compiled into
\begin{itemize} 
\item one or more smart contracts (potentially written in Plutus) and 
\item a client side program or interface that has a limited number of choices to be made at each point in time (including an interface for the observables). 
\end{itemize}
Of course, we probably do not want to give a user a programmatic interface but an actual application with user interface. So there is still some work to be done to create interfaces on top of the client side of the contracts.

The Cardano platform has a notion of cost, and Marlowe contracts will potentially incur costs of two kinds:
\begin{itemize} 
\item The cost of a single transaction execution (a single Plutus validator).
\item The cost of the whole contract, which may consist of many transactions.
\end{itemize} 
Even in Ethereum this distinction is important because single contract execution is limited by gas (and is thus finite), whereas the life of the whole contract may be unbounded and consist of an indefinite number of transactions.  So far we are assuming contracts defined in Marlowe to be finite in both aspects. They could be infinite if we were to define them co-inductively as recursive members of the DSL type.



\section{Response to comments on the original document made by Charles on Slack}

Legend: {\it a quote from this document}, Charles' response, {\bf our reply}:


{\it
First, it will need to observe different kinds of varying quantities including, for example, the current time, the current block number and, random numbers, as well as ``real world'' quantities like ``the price of oil'' or ``the exchange rate between currencies A and B''. Each instance of such an observable will be recorded on the blockchain to allow the computation to be repeated for verification purposes. It is assumed that at each step of the execution of the contract, the values of some observables will be needed.
}

We need to get a better notion of observation. 


There seem to be two broad categories of events worth observing. One that is derived from the network itself and one that is from an external source. 


For example, we could consider a game where the contract executes based upon the value of a block header, this is something known after it occurs and cannot be changed.
Whereas the price of oil is not.



{\bf
Indeed, we agree. The former kind of observations are already artefacts on the blockchain, whereas the latter need to be stored on the blockchain. We have assumed that the infrastructure for the language supports this recording: we would not expect language users to have to do this for themselves.
}

{\bf
Apart from this difference in the infrastructure, we see no difference between the two different sorts of observations: is this correct?
}

The question of commitment to blockchain is interesting as who should have write access and also how do we prevent an enormous amount of bad data from being posted? And is it necessary at all?


We could specify the format of an answer and have them commit it to the blockchain as a signed hash and then it could be externally shared for example and everyone would be able to determine it is correct.

{\bf
We saw that commitments were an integral part of the game playing process, and so we wanted to include them as primitives in the language. Yes, they are usually implemented as hashes, but we wanted to give a more abstract presentation here. 


Concerning bad data, a commitment will usually just store the hash, but the problem seems to come at the reveal, when all the data has to be shown, somehow. We don't have to store the whole data (just the hash) but it does have to be revealed in some way that can be observed, and the naive interpretation of this is that it is made available somehow, thereby using storage on the blockchain.


There may be other ways of doing this. Is there some sort of compact proof that can be used here?


Or can we devolve to a trusted third party, off chain?
}

I'm also curious about expectations. For example, say we have an oil contract.


We have an expectation of exchange rates or something like that so we'd expect some int to float and then a float to float. Examples:


   * 1 barrel for 120.55 dollars.
   * 22 dollars for 1 ada.


Gives us everything we need to act on the contract accordingly in a deterministic way.


First, we guess these may be fixed or rational rather than float :-) We would assume that exchange rates are observables, with values recorded at the point of use, so that re-computation is possible (and deterministic). 

{\bf
In general, we need a more powerful expression language (e.g. through embedding the DSL). Maybe we could use a subset of Plutus.
}


{\it
Second, it will be necessary to ensure that commitments of various kinds have been made by the participants in a contract.
}

Ok, Bernardo knows a lot more about this than I do. He's been doing this type of stuff with his MPC work. I'd recommend having a discussion with Aggelos and Bernardo about
commitments in the cryptocurrency world.

{\bf
Yes, certainly, we will do this.
}

{\it
What are the valid contracts? One possible definition is ``those contracts that do not lead to a FailedPay action''. Does this make sense independently of the inputs to a contract (i.e. observables, commitments, redeems, time, and randomness)?
}

I tend to think of compositions.
So we have things like multisig where the players setup a special contract tailored to a set of business and trust assumptions. This game ends when funds are spent.
Complexity could be fairly arbitrary as the conditions to spend could be quite complex and involve lots of business logic. The end of the game could initiate a new game.

{\bf
A game that starts a new game is essentially a bigger game. There seems to be a limitation about commitments. Commitments need to be voluntary by nature, so if there are no commitments inherited between the two games, then it should be no different to model both the games separately.


There should not be a problem to model infinite games either by using co-induction.
}

For example creating a new multisig account with the same logic for the change address.


Then we have event based games, where actions occur when something happens, a triggering event.


For example a deadman switch.


If bob doesn't sign a special transaction each month, then send all the money to alice.


These are at the mercy of the oracle connected to the contract.


Then we have games of interaction, such as poker for example.


Bob and Alice have earned the right to interact with each other with special rules and pending how those interactions end up, we have a transfer of value between them and others.


Abstractly, I suppose there is a notion of entry condition, allowed actions and exit conditions.

{\bf
Not sure what entry and exit conditions are, but commitments may well be entry conditions, or at least a crucial component of them. We think that all the examples described can be implemented in the DSL (assuming we add the proper observables and oracles). Maybe we need some more cryptographic primitives for poker, that is probably something we should discuss with Aggelos and Bernardo.
}




{\it
Null is the null contract; it will always be quiescent.
}

Just to clarify, null means termination or just dormancy?

{\bf
Both. A contract has terminated if it has evolved to be exactly null. But there exist contracts that contain the null contract but have not terminated.
}

{\it
Do all contracts potentially evaluate to Null? That is, for each contract do there exist sequences of values of Commit and OS such that stepping the contract with these inputs leads to Null? Might we have to rule out unsatisfiable observations?
}

If I understand null to mean the contract has finished all possible execution, then this is a reasonable assumption given a certain viewpoint completion of a multisig contract for example could be interpreted as a null case.


But in a strict sense the answer is no, there can be cases where something is in a pending state indefinitely. For example, for a 2 of 3 contract, two keyholders could die then you'd have an active contract waiting for completion, but it will never happen.

{\bf
I understand this as: all contracts should reduce to null, but not independently of the observables. We can then think about analysing which observables stall the contract (which sounds like a boolean satisfiability problem). Maybe we just want to guarantee that there is a set of external actions that will cause the contract to reduce to null no matter its state.


In the particular example of death of participants, we would assume that the contract would have been formulated with timeouts on inactivity of participants (when activity requested).
}

What we need to do is determine what functionality can be black-boxed in this model with some degree of reliability.


Bernardo's MPC library is going to provide a lot of functionality for things like games for example and provides strong cryptographic guarantees for outcomes given some initial assumptions.

{\bf
We will definitely incorporate these.
}

Second, we need to have a set of canonical actions that we could test against the proposed model. And see how they would be constructed.

{\bf
Is this like a test suite? Not sure how it would work, but would like to know more.
}

Third, we need to clearly understand what is an oracle in this model and how we intend on using them.





{\bf
Good point, we need to define an interface for oracles.
